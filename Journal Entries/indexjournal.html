        Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House 
    <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> Laurel Schwulst, presents a captivating metaphor of a website as a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. Schwulst beautifully encapsulates the dynamic nature of online spaces, suggesting that they should evolve, adapt, and transform just as a house changes its form. Her metaphor of a river of knowledge resonates deeply, symbolizing the constant flow of ideas and information that we encounter on the internet. As I consider my own digital identity, I find myself inspired to craft a space that fosters exploration, growth, and a harmonious blend of creativity and adaptability. </p>

        Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p>  Ursula K. Le Guin, a profound exploration of the concept of "technology" awaits. Le Guin dismantles the conventional understanding of technology as mere machinery and gadgets, urging us to recognize its broader role as problem-solving and task-accomplishing tools. She strikes a chord by highlighting the ethical dimension of technology, cautioning against a profit-driven approach that neglects human well-being and environmental impact. Le Guin's thought-provoking words prompt me to reevaluate how I perceive technology, considering its potential for both positive and negative outcomes based on how it's harnessed. </p>

        J.R. CARPENTER, A Handmade Web
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> In reflecting on the reading about technology, craftsmanship, and design, I find the idea intriguing that despite the increasing complexity of technology, there is a growing appreciation for it. The comparison between appreciating art without knowing its context and navigating the web without understanding its workings resonates with me. It's true; the magic lies in understanding how something is made. The notion that art and design, including web design, operate in cycles makes sense. While new technologies and trends emerge, it's the lasting beauty found in handcrafted creations that captivates us. The uniqueness of these creations allows for a more direct and honest connection to the artist and the maker, adding depth to the overall experience. 
            In essence, this reflection reinforces the idea that amidst the ever-evolving technological landscape, there is a timeless appreciation for craftsmanship and the human touch. It's a reminder that in understanding the intricacies of creation, we uncover a deeper, more meaningful connection to the things we interact with, whether it be a piece of art or a well-designed website.  </p>
