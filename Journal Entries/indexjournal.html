        Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House 
    <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> Laurel Schwulst, presents a captivating metaphor of a website as a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. Schwulst beautifully encapsulates the dynamic nature of online spaces, suggesting that they should evolve, adapt, and transform just as a house changes its form. Her metaphor of a river of knowledge resonates deeply, symbolizing the constant flow of ideas and information that we encounter on the internet. As I consider my own digital identity, I find myself inspired to craft a space that fosters exploration, growth, and a harmonious blend of creativity and adaptability. </p>

        Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p>  Ursula K. Le Guin, a profound exploration of the concept of "technology" awaits. Le Guin dismantles the conventional understanding of technology as mere machinery and gadgets, urging us to recognize its broader role as problem-solving and task-accomplishing tools. She strikes a chord by highlighting the ethical dimension of technology, cautioning against a profit-driven approach that neglects human well-being and environmental impact. Le Guin's thought-provoking words prompt me to reevaluate how I perceive technology, considering its potential for both positive and negative outcomes based on how it's harnessed. </p>
