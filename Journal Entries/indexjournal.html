        Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House 
    <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> Laurel Schwulst, presents a captivating metaphor of a website as a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. Schwulst beautifully encapsulates the dynamic nature of online spaces, suggesting that they should evolve, adapt, and transform just as a house changes its form. Her metaphor of a river of knowledge resonates deeply, symbolizing the constant flow of ideas and information that we encounter on the internet. As I consider my own digital identity, I find myself inspired to craft a space that fosters exploration, growth, and a harmonious blend of creativity and adaptability. </p>

        Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p>  Ursula K. Le Guin, a profound exploration of the concept of "technology" awaits. Le Guin dismantles the conventional understanding of technology as mere machinery and gadgets, urging us to recognize its broader role as problem-solving and task-accomplishing tools. She strikes a chord by highlighting the ethical dimension of technology, cautioning against a profit-driven approach that neglects human well-being and environmental impact. Le Guin's thought-provoking words prompt me to reevaluate how I perceive technology, considering its potential for both positive and negative outcomes based on how it's harnessed. </p>

        J.R. CARPENTER, A Handmade Web
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> In reflecting on the reading about technology, craftsmanship, and design, I find the idea intriguing that despite the increasing complexity of technology, there is a growing appreciation for it. The comparison between appreciating art without knowing its context and navigating the web without understanding its workings resonates with me. It's true; the magic lies in understanding how something is made. The notion that art and design, including web design, operate in cycles makes sense. While new technologies and trends emerge, it's the lasting beauty found in handcrafted creations that captivates us. The uniqueness of these creations allows for a more direct and honest connection to the artist and the maker, adding depth to the overall experience. 
            In essence, this reflection reinforces the idea that amidst the ever-evolving technological landscape, there is a timeless appreciation for craftsmanship and the human touch. It's a reminder that in understanding the intricacies of creation, we uncover a deeper, more meaningful connection to the things we interact with, whether it be a piece of art or a well-designed website.  </p>

        Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> The author embarks on a journey to build a computer from scratch, sharing experiences in learning about electricity and computation. They criticize the Silicon Valley mythology, highlighting untold stories of militarization and mass production that shaped the computing industry. The historical foundation is laid with a focus on human computation before the computer era.

            The reflection emphasizes the growing gap between users and machines, discussing the familiar yet often opaque computer interface. The author simplifies technical aspects, describing computers as objects performing basic, repeated operations. Parallels are drawn between computer micrographs and works of art and architecture, highlighting repetition as a powerful tool in scaling tasks.
            
            The reflection provocatively questions whether cities can be considered computers for humans, citing the unpredictability of urban life. Readers are encouraged to recognize cultural complexities and consider the kinds of computers and cities they desire. The teaser for the next chapter, "Skating the Circuits," promises further exploration of the intersections between technology and human experience. </p>

        Mindy Seu - The Poetry of Tools
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> The text explores the intersection of technology and poetry, emphasizing the poetic nature inherent in digital tools and interfaces. The author invites readers to reflect on their interactions with digital devices, encouraging a mindful consideration of the gestures performed daily. The narrative criticizes the uncritical adoption of new technologies, urging a more conscious engagement.

            The reflection delves into various categories within the poetry of tools, including "Slow Growth & Slow Death," which explores the living nature of the web and how technology can be both alive and susceptible to decay. "Early Works" examines the emergence of poetic forms in human-computer interaction, shaped by technological constraints. "Performing Data" focuses on visualizing and reordering data to create poetic expressions.
            
            The section on "Removing Function from Form" discusses artists who reimagine the outward-facing elements of tools, separating aesthetics from their intended purpose. "Production of Errors" explores the artistic value of errors in digital communication, embracing mistakes and turning them into platforms for creativity. Lastly, "Regeneration" highlights how technology can revive old works, preserving and updating them for contemporary audiences. </p>

        Becca Abbe, The Internet's Back-to-the-Land Movement        
        <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p> The reading explores the historical and ideological trajectory of movements seeking alternatives to mainstream societal structures, from the Club of Rome's attempt to counteract global resource depletion to the back-to-the-land and digital utopian movements. It highlights the failures and shifts in focus, from physical communes to online communities like the WELL. The discussion then transitions to the environmental impact of the internet and proposes a "back-to-the-land" movement in the digital realm. The analogy is drawn between the limits of physical resources and the environmental impact of the internet, suggesting alternatives like decentralized networks and local hosting. The conclusion underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the virtual environment to regain control and make conscious choices in navigating the web's growth. </p>
